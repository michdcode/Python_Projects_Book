Projects from the book PYTHON PLAYGROUND: PYTHON PLAYGROUND: Geeky Projects for the Curious Programmer

Project #1 - iTunes Library
The project will take an iTunes library that you have downloaded as an XML file, and parse it. It will find any duplicate songs in the library and output a list of the duplicates into a text file. Also, it will take the duration data and rating data (if any) from each song and plot it using matplotlib. [Here is a picture of the plot from the songs in one of my iTunes libraries.](Python_Projects_Book/Screen Shot 2016-08-22 at 3.48.32 PM.png) Also, I blogged about this project [here.](https://michdcode.com/2016/08/22/the-prettiest-data/)

Project #2 - Spirographs
The project creates spirographs using python's turtle module, which is reminiscent of my childhood, both because I loved drawing spirographs and I loved programming in Logo. [Here is a picture of the spirographs created by the program.](Python_Projects_Book/spiro-28Aug2016-170639.eps)
